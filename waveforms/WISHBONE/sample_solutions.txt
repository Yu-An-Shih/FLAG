Reset (Figure 3-1):
(RULE 3.20)
- If RST_I is HIGH, then STB_O is LOW in the next cycle.
- If RST_I is HIGH, then CYC_O is LOW in the next cycle.

Data transfer:
(3.1.3 Handshaking Protocol)
- If STB_O is HIGH and ACK_I is LOW, then STB_O should be HIGH in the next cycle.
(RULE 3.60)
- If STB_O is HIGH and ACK_I is LOW, then ADR_O should remain stable in the next cycle.
- If STB_O is HIGH and ACK_I is LOW, then WE_O should remain stable in the next cycle.
- If STB_O is HIGH and ACK_I is LOW, then SEL_O should remain stable in the next cycle.
- If STB_O is HIGH, ACK_I is LOW and WE_O is HIGH, then DAT_O should remain stable in the next cycle.
(RULE 3.35)
- If STB_O changes from LOW to HIGH, then ACK_I must be HIGH eventually.
(OBSERVATION 3.25)
- If STB_O is HIGH, then CYC_I is HIGH.

STB vs CYC:
(OBSERVATION 3.25)
- If STB_O is HIGH, then CYC_I is HIGH.

Handshake (Figure 2-2, 2-3):
- If QREQn is HIGH and (QACCEPTn is LOW / QDENY is HIGH), then QREQn should remain HIGH in the next cycle.
- If QREQn is LOW, QACCEPTn is HIGH and QDENY is LOW, then QREQn should remain LOW in the next cycle.
- If QACCEPTn is HIGH and (QREQn is HIGH / QDENY is HIGH), then QACCEPTn should remain HIGH in the next cycle.
- If QACCEPTn is LOW and QREQn is LOW, then QACCEPTn should remain LOW in the next cycle.
- If QDENY is LOW and (QREQn is HIGH / QACCEPTn is HIGH), then QDENY should remain LOW in the next cycle.
- If QDENY is HIGH and QREQn is LOW, then QDENY should remain HIGH in the next cycle.
Or,
- If QREQn changes from HIGH to LOW, then QACCEPTn is HIGH and QDENY is LOW (in the previous cycle).
- If QREQn changes from LOW to HIGH, then either QACCEPTn is LOW and QDENY is LOW, or QACCEPTn is HIGH and QDENY is HIGH (in the previous cycle).
  + Or: If QREQn changes from LOW to HIGH, then either QACCEPTn is LOW or QDENY is HIGH (in the previous cycle).
- If QACCEPTn changes from HIGH to LOW, then QREQn is LOW and QDENY is LOW (in the previous cycle).
- If QACCEPTn changes from LOW to HIGH, then QREQn is HIGH and QDENY is LOW (in the previous cycle).
- If QDENY changes from HIGH to LOW, then QREQn is HIGH and QACCEPTn is HIGH (in the previous cycle).
- If QDENY changes from LOW to HIGH, then QREQn is LOW and QACCEPTn is HIGH (in the previous cycle).

- (How to interpret?) QACCEPTn is LOW and QDENY is HIGH should never occur at the same time.

Reset (Figure 2-4, 2-5):
- If RESETn is LOW, then QACCEPTn is LOW.
- If RESETn is LOW, then QDENY is LOW.

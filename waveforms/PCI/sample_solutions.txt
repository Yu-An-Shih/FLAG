Bus Transactions (Figure 3-5, 3-6):
  Auxiliary signals: READ_DATA_PHASE, WRITE_DATA_PHASE
- If (READ_DATA_PHASE / WRITE_DATA_PHASE) and (IRDY# / TRDY#) is HIGH, then C/BE# must remain stable in the next cycle.
- (Turnaround cycle) If $rose(READ_DATA_PHASE), then TRDY# must be HIGH.

- If TRDY# is LOW, then DEVSEL# must be LOW.

- (Repeated by Rule 3 on page 51) If $rose(FRAME#), then IDRY# must be LOW.

Not described by text
- If READ_DATA_PHASE, TRDY# is LOW and IRDY# is HIGH, then AD must remain stable in the next cycle.
- If WRITE_DATA_PHASE, IRDY# is LOW and TRDY# is HIGH, then AD must remain stable in the next cycle.


Master Initiated Termination (Figure 3-7, 3-8):
(Rule 2 on page 51)
- (subsumption by Rule 4) If FRAME# is HIGH, IRDY# is LOW, TRDY# is HIGH, STOP# is HIGH and DEVSEL# is LOW, then FRAME# must remain HIGH in the next cycle.
(Rule 3 on page 51)
- If $rose(FRAME#), then IDRY# must be LOW.
(Rule 4 on page 51)
- If IRDY# is LOW, TRDY# is HIGH, STOP# is HIGH and DEVSEL# is LOW, then IRDY# must remain LOW in the next cycle.
- If IRDY# is LOW, TRDY# is HIGH, STOP# is HIGH and DEVSEL# is LOW, then FRAME# must remain stable in the next cycle.
(Rule 5 on page 51)
- If FRAME# is HIGH, IRDY# is LOW and (TRDY# is LOW / STOP# is LOW), then IRDY# is HIGH in the next cycle.

(Master-abort)
- If $rose(IRDY), then MASTER_ABORT_NOT_ALLOWED == 0.
- If FRAME# is HIGH, IRDY# is LOW, (DEVSEL# is HIGH) and MASTER_ABORT_NOT_ALLOWED == 0, then IRDY# is HIGH in the next cycle.


Target Initiated Termination (Figure 3-9 ~ 3-14):
(Rule 3 on page 53)
- If STOP# is LOW and FRAME# is LOW, then STOP# remains LOW in the next cycle.
- If STOP# is LOW and FRAME# is HIGH, then STOP# should be HIGH in the next cycle.
(Rule 4 on page 53)
- If (TRDY# / STOP#) is LOW and IRDY# is HIGH, then (DEVSEL# / TRDY# / STOP#) remains stable in the next cycle.
(Rule 5 on page 53)
- If STOP# is LOW, then (FRAME# is HIGH or IRDY# is HIGH) in the next cycle.
(Rule 6 on page 54)
- If FRAME# is HIGH, IRDY# is LOW and (TRDY# / STOP#) is LOW, then (TRDY# / STOP# / DEVSEL#) should be HIGH in the next cycle.


Notes:
1. Turnaround cycles
  - If $fell(FRAME#), then (IRDY# / TRDY# / DEVSEL# / STOP#) are in their turnaround cycles.
  - If IDLE state between transactions, then (FRAME# / C/BE# / AD) are in their turnaround cycles.

Excercise: Try creating an invalid sequence which bypasses all the rules above.

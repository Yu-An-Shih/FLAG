Valid/Ready handshake (Figure 3-1 ~ 3-3):
- If VALID is HIGH and READY is LOW, then VALID is HIGH in the next cycle.
- If VALID is HIGH and READY is LOW, then INFORMATION must remain stable in the next cycle.
(- If VALID is HIGH, then INFORMATION should not be X.)

Exit from reset (Figure 11-1):
- If ARESETn is LOW, then VALID must be LOW.
- If ARESETn changes from LOW to HIGH, then VALID must be LOW.

Low-power handshake (Figure 12-1 ~ 12-3):
- If CSYSREQ is HIGH and CSYSACK is LOW, then CSYSREQ must remain HIGH in the next cycle.
- If CSYSREQ is LOW and CSYSACK is HIGH, then CSYSREQ must remain LOW in the next cycle.
- If CSYSACK is HIGH and CSYSREQ is HIGH, then CSYSACK must remain HIGH in the next cycle.
- If CSYSACK is LOW and CSYSREQ is LOW, then CSYSACK must remain LOW in the next cycle.
Or,
- If CSYSREQ changes from HIGH to LOW, then CSYSACK is HIGH (in the previous cycle).
- If CSYSREQ changes from LOW to HIGH, then CSYSACK is LOW (in the previous cycle).
- If CSYSACK changes from HIGH to LOW, then CSYSREQ is LOW (in the previous cycle).
- If CSYSACK changes from LOW to HIGH, then CSYSREQ is HIGH (in the previous cycle).
Or, 
- If CSYSREQ is permitted to change from HIGH to LOW, then CSYSACK is HIGH.

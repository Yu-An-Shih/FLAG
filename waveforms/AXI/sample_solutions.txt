Valid/Ready handshake:
- If VALID is HIGH and READY is LOW, then VALID is HIGH in the next cycle.
- If VALID is HIGH and READY is LOW, then INFORMATION must remain stable in the next cycle.
- If VALID is HIGH, then INFORMATION should not be X.

Exit from reset:
- If ARESETn is LOW, then VALID must be LOW.
- If ARESETn changes from LOW to HIGH, then VALID must be LOW.

Low-power handshake:
- If CSYSREQ changes from HIGH to LOW, then CSYSACK is HIGH (in the previous cycle).
- If CSYSREQ changes from LOW to HIGH, then CSYSACK is LOW (in the previous cycle).
- If CSYSACK changes from HIGH to LOW, then CSYSREQ is LOW (in the previous cycle).
- If CSYSACK changes from LOW to HIGH, then CSYSREQ is HIGH (in the previous cycle).
Or, 
- If CSYSREQ is permitted to change from HIGH to LOW, then CSYSACK is HIGH.

Transfers (Figure 3-1, 3-2, 3-4, 3-5, 3-6):
- If PSEL is HIGH and (PENABLE / PREADY) is LOW, then PSEL should remain HIGH in the next cycle.
- If PSEL is HIGH and (PENABLE / PREADY) is LOW, then (PADDR / PWRITE) should remain stable in the next cycle.
- If PSEL is HIGH, PWRITE is HIGH and (PENABLE / PREADY) is LOW, then PWDATA should remain stable in the next cycle.
(Constraints for PENABLE)
- If $rose(PSEL), then PENABLE should be LOW.
- If PSEL is HIGH and PENABLE is LOW, then PENABLE should be HIGH in the next cycle.
- If PENABLE is HIGH and PREADY is LOW, then PENABLE should remain HIGH in the next cycle.
- If PENABLE is HIGH and PREADY is HIGH, then PENABLE should be LOW in the next cycle.

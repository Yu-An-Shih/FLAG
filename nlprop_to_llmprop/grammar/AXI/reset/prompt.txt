I am providing you a properties_NL_grammar_AXI_reset.json file. The file contains a set of properties that were generated using a template, from the waveforms in the text. I am now providing you a textual description of what the reset behavior should be. Please extract the properties that best describe the reset relationship described in the textual description and return them in a json file. The properties must come from the json file. Do not include properties that are not directly mentioned in the text. Do not make assumptions from the text.

Here is the textual description:
11.1 Clock and reset requirements 
This section gives the requirements for implementing the ACLK and ARESETn signals. 

11.1.1 Clock 
Each AXI component uses a single clock signal, ACLK. All input signals are sampled on the rising edge of ACLK. All output signal changes must occur after the rising edge of ACLK. 
There must be no combinatorial paths between input and output signals on both master and slave interfaces. 

11.1.2 Reset 
The AXI protocol includes a single active LOW reset signal, ARESETn. The reset signal can be asserted asynchronously, but deassertion must be synchronous after the rising edge of ACLK. 
During reset the following interface requirements apply: 
	• a master interface must drive ARVALID, AWVALID, and WVALID LOW 
	• a slave interface must drive RVALID and BVALID LOW. 

All other signals can be driven to any value. 

A master interface must begin driving ARVALID, AWVALID, or WVALID HIGH only at a rising ACLK edge after ARESETn is HIGH. Figure 11-1 shows the first point after reset that ARVALID, AWVALID, or WVALID, can be driven HIGH.

3.1.3 Use of [STB_O]
All bus cycles use a handshaking protocol between the MASTER and SLAVE interfaces. As shown in Figure 3-2, the MASTER asserts [STB_O] when it is ready to transfer data. [STB_O] remains asserted until the SLAVE asserts one of the cycle terminating signals [ACK_I], [ERR_I] or [RTY_I]. At every rising edge of [CLK_I] the terminating signal is sampled. If it is asserted, then [STB_O] is negated. This gives both MASTER and SLAVE interfaces the possibility to control the rate at which data is transferred.

RULE 3.35
The cycle termination signals [ACK_O], [ERR_O], and [RTY_O] must be generated in response to the logical AND of [CYC_I] and [STB_I].

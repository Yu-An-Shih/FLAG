P-Channel:
1. 
• PSTATE can only transition when either:
— PREQ, PACCEPT, and PDENY are all LOW.
— PREQ and PDENY are both HIGH and PACCEPT is LOW.

The LLM seems to struggle with this property. This is the target property:
"If PDENY is LOW and PREQ is HIGH, then PSTATE remains stable in the next cycle."
Could it be looking for properties that include all three signals (PREQ, PACCEPT, PDENY)?

PCI:
1. 
For master termination, both the waveform and text do not contain the STOP# signal, and 
the relationship between TRDY# and STOP#
A possible solution is to merge target termination and master termination

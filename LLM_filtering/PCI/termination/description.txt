Textual Description of the PCI protocol's transaction termination mechanism:
"""
2.2.3 Interface Control Pins

FRAME#
Cycle Frame is driven by the current master to indicate the beginning and duration of an access. FRAME# is asserted to indicate a bus transaction is beginning. While FRAME# is asserted, data transfers continue. When FRAME# is deasserted, the transaction is in the final data phase or has completed.

IRDY#
Initiator Ready indicates the initiating agent’s (bus master’s) ability to complete the current data phase of the transaction. IRDY# is used in conjunction with TRDY#. A data phase is completed on any clock both IRDY# and TRDY# are asserted. During a write, IRDY# indicates that valid data is present on AD[31::00]. During a read, it indicates the master is prepared to accept data. Wait cycles are inserted until both IRDY# and TRDY# are asserted together.

TRDY#
Target Ready indicates the target agent’s (selected device’s) ability to complete the current data phase of the transaction. TRDY# is used in conjunction with IRDY#. A data phase is completed on any clock both TRDY# and IRDY# are asserted. During a read, TRDY# indicates that valid data is present on AD[31::00]. During a write, it indicates the target is prepared to accept data. Wait cycles are inserted until both IRDY# and TRDY# are asserted together.

STOP#
Stop indicates the current target is requesting the master to stop the current transaction.

DEVSEL#
Device Select, when actively driven, indicates the driving device has decoded its address as the target of the current access. As an input, DEVSEL# indicates whether any device on the bus has been selected.

Note: A # symbol at the end of a signal name indicates that the asserted state occurs when the signal is at low voltage. When the # symbol is absent, the signal is asserted at a high voltage.


3.3.3.1. Master Initiated Termination

The mechanism used in master initiated termination is when FRAME# is deasserted and IRDY# is asserted. This condition signals the target that the final data phase is in progress. The final data transfer occurs when both IRDY# and TRDY# are asserted. The transaction reaches completion when both FRAME# and IRDY# are deasserted (Idle state).

Two examples of normal completion are shown in Figure 3-7. The final data phase is indicated by the deassertion of FRAME# and the assertion of IRDY#. The final data phase completes when FRAME# is deasserted and IRDY# and TRDY# are both asserted. The bus reaches an Idle state when IRDY# is deasserted, which occurs on clock 4. Because the transaction has completed, TRDY# is deasserted on clock 4 also.
Note: TRDY# is not required to be asserted on clock 3, but could have delayed the final data transfer (and transaction termination) until it is ready by delaying the final assertion of TRDY#. If the target does that, the master is required to keep IRDY# asserted until the final data transfer occurs.

In summary, the following general rules govern FRAME# and IRDY# in all PCI transactions:
1. FRAME# and its corresponding IRDY# define the Busy/Idle state of the bus; when either is asserted, the bus is Busy; when both are deasserted, the bus is Idle.
2. Once FRAME# has been deasserted, it cannot be reasserted during the same transaction.
3. FRAME# cannot be deasserted unless IRDY# is asserted. (IRDY# must always be asserted on the first clock edge that FRAME# is deasserted.)
4. Once a master has asserted IRDY#, it cannot change IRDY# or FRAME# until the current data phase completes.
5. The master must deassert IRDY# the clock after the completion of the last data phase.


3.3.3.2. Target Initiated Termination

The following general rules govern FRAME#, IRDY#, TRDY#, STOP#, and DEVSEL# while terminating transactions:
1. A data phase completes on any rising clock edge on which IRDY# is asserted and either STOP# or TRDY# is asserted.
2. Independent of the state of STOP#, a data transfer takes place on every rising edge of the clock where both IRDY# and TRDY# are asserted.
3. Once the target asserts STOP#, it must keep STOP# asserted until FRAME# is deasserted, whereupon it must deassert STOP#.
4. Once a target has asserted TRDY# or STOP#, it cannot change DEVSEL#, TRDY#, or STOP# until the current data phase completes.
5. Whenever STOP# is asserted, the master must deassert FRAME# as soon as IRDY# can be asserted.
6. If not already deasserted, TRDY#, STOP#, and DEVSEL# must be deasserted the clock following the completion of the last data phase and must be tri-stated the next clock.

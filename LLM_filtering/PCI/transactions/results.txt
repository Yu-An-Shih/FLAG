These rules capture the key points from the provided PCI description:

1) PCI cannot be in both a read‐data and write‐data phase at the same time.  
2) Data transfer completes only when both IRDY# and TRDY# are asserted (both low); otherwise a wait cycle is inserted and the current phase “remains stable.”

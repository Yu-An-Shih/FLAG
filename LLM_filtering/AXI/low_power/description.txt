Textual Description of the AXI protocol's low-power interface:
"""
12.2 Low-power clock control

For a more complex peripheral with a power-down or power-up sequence, entry into a low-power state occurs only after a request from the system clock controller. The AXI protocol provides a two-wire request/acknowledge handshake to support this request:
CSYSREQ: To request that the peripheral enter a low-power state, the system clock controller drives the CSYSREQ signal LOW. During normal operation, CSYSREQ is HIGH.
CSYSACK: The peripheral uses the CSYSACK signal to acknowledge both the low-power state request and the exit from the low-power state.

Figure 12-1 shows the relationship between CSYSREQ and CSYSACK.
At the start of the sequence in Figure 12-1, both CSYSREQ and CSYSACK are HIGH for normal clocked operation. At time T1, the system clock controller deasserts CSYSREQ, indicating a request to put the peripheral in a low-power state. The peripheral acknowledges the request at time T2 by deasserting CSYSACK. At T3, the system clock controller asserts CSYSREQ to indicate the exit from the low-power state, and the peripheral asserts CSYSACK at T4 to acknowledge the exit.
This relationship between CSYSREQ and CSYSACK is a requirement of the AXI protocol.

The peripheral can accept or deny the request for a low-power state from the system clock controller. The level of the CACTIVE signal when the peripheral acknowledges the request by deasserting CSYSACK indicates the acceptance or denial of the request.

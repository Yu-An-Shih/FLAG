Textual Description of the AXI protocol's reset requirements:
"""
11.1.2 Reset

The AXI protocol includes a single active LOW reset signal, ARESETn. The reset signal can be asserted asynchronously, but deassertion must be synchronous after the rising edge of ACLK. 

During reset the following interface requirements apply: 
	• a master interface must drive ARVALID, AWVALID, and WVALID LOW
	• a slave interface must drive RVALID and BVALID LOW.
All other signals can be driven to any value.

A master interface must begin driving ARVALID, AWVALID, or WVALID HIGH only at a rising ACLK edge after ARESETn is HIGH. Figure 11-1 shows the first point after reset that ARVALID, AWVALID, or WVALID, can be driven HIGH.

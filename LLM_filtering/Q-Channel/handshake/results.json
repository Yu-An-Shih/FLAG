Below is the list of candidate rules that, taken together, correspond most closely to the handshake‐relationship described in the Q‑Channel specification. In the text the allowed transitions are as follows:

• QREQn is allowed to go from HIGH→LOW only if QACCEPTn is HIGH and QDENY is LOW. (This is captured by the two rules below.)
• QACCEPTn is allowed to go from HIGH→LOW only if QREQn is LOW and QDENY is LOW.
• QACCEPTn is allowed to go from LOW→HIGH only if QREQn is HIGH and QDENY is LOW.
• QDENY is allowed to go from HIGH→LOW only if QREQn is HIGH and QACCEPTn is HIGH.
• QDENY is allowed to go from LOW→HIGH only if QREQn is LOW and QACCEPTn is HIGH.

From the candidate list the following rules match these transitions:

[
  "If QREQn changes from HIGH to LOW, then QACCEPTn is HIGH.",
  "If QREQn changes from HIGH to LOW, then QDENY is LOW.",
  "If QACCEPTn changes from HIGH to LOW, then QREQn is LOW.",
  "If QACCEPTn changes from HIGH to LOW, then QDENY is LOW.",
  "If QACCEPTn changes from LOW to HIGH, then QREQn is HIGH.",
  "If QACCEPTn changes from LOW to HIGH, then QDENY is LOW.",
  "If QDENY changes from HIGH to LOW, then QREQn is HIGH.",
  "If QDENY changes from HIGH to LOW, then QACCEPTn is HIGH.",
  "If QDENY changes from LOW to HIGH, then QREQn is LOW.",
  "If QDENY changes from LOW to HIGH, then QACCEPTn is HIGH."
]

Each rule here corresponds to one of the direction‐and‐condition handshake restrictions given in the specification. (Note that the “LOW‐to‐HIGH” transition for QREQn is defined in two mutually–exclusive cases; none of the provided candidates exactly capture that “either … or …” requirement so we have omitted a candidate rule for that transition.)

2.1.2 Q-Channel handshake

This section describes the permitted variations of the Q-Channel interface handshake.

Accepted quiescence request
Figure 2-2 shows a handshake sequence for an accepted quiescence request. It includes the guaranteed activity of an optional controller-supplied clock that is managed according to the interface semantics.
Figure 2-2 omits QACTIVE because although QACTIVE can act as a stimulus for the controller to change interface state, it is independent of the handshake. All interface state changes can be initiated by the controller alone.
The transitions shown in Figure 2-2 are:
• At T1, QREQn and QACCEPTn are both HIGH. This state is referred to as Q_RUN and the device is operational. QDENY is LOW in Q_RUN. In this state, the controller guarantees the availability of any clock or power supply that is managed by the interface.
• At T2, QREQn is driven LOW by the controller, requesting entry to a quiescent state. This state is referred to as Q_REQUEST. The device remains operational. In this state, the controller guarantees the availability of any clock or power supply that is managed by the interface.
• At T3, the device responds to the quiescence request by driving QACCEPTn LOW. QDENY remains LOW. This state is referred to as Q_STOPPED. The device is not operational. In this state, the controller does not guarantee the availability of any clock or power supply that is managed by the interface.
• At T4, the controller drives QREQn HIGH. Both acknowledgment signals remain LOW. This state is referred to as Q_EXIT. Any clock or power supply managed by the interface is guaranteed after an implementation-dependent delay, but once supplied, is guaranteed to be provided.
• At T5, the device responds to the controller with QACCEPTn HIGH, and QDENY remains LOW. The interface has returned to the state Q_RUN as at T1.

Denied quiescence request
Figure 2-3 shows a handshake sequence for a denied quiescence request. It includes the guaranteed activity of an optional controller-supplied clock that is managed according to the interface semantics.
The transitions shown in Figure 2-3 are:
• The sequence from T1 to T2 is identical to that described in Accepted quiescence request.
• At T3, the device drives QDENY HIGH while QACCEPTn remains HIGH. This state is referred to as Q_DENIED. The device remains operational and the controller must guarantee any clock or power supply managed by the interface.
• At T4, the controller drives QREQn HIGH. This state is referred to as Q_CONTINUE and is in response to the quiescence request denial at T3. The device remains operational and the controller must guarantee any clock or power supply managed by the interface.
• At T5, the device drives QDENY LOW. The interface has returned to the state Q_RUN, as at T1.

Handshake rules
The handshake signaling rules are:
• QREQn can only transition from HIGH to LOW when QACCEPTn is HIGH and QDENY is LOW.
• QREQn can only transition from LOW to HIGH when either:
  — QACCEPTn and QDENY are both LOW.
  — QACCEPTn and QDENY are both HIGH.
• QACCEPTn can only transition from HIGH to LOW when QREQn is LOW and QDENY is LOW.
• QACCEPTn can only transition from LOW to HIGH when QREQn is HIGH and QDENY is LOW.
• QDENY can only transition from HIGH to LOW when QREQn is HIGH and QACCEPTn is HIGH.
• QDENY can only transition from LOW to HIGH when QREQn is LOW and QACCEPTn is HIGH.

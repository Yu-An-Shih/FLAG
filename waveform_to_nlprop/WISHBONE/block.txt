WISHBONE bus cycle vs data transfer cycles:
    Trace:
        CYC_I: 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
        STB_I: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0
        ACK_O: 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
    Signal descriptions:
        CYC_I (source: master): Active-high cycle signal. Indicates that a valid bus cycle is in progress.
        STB_I (source: master): Active-high strobe signal. Indicates that a data transfer cycle is in progress. A valid bus cycle can consist of multiple data transfer cycles.
        ACK_O (source: slave): Active-high acknowledge signal. Indicates the termination of a normal data transfer cycle.
    Instructions:
        1. Please observe the relationship between CYC_I and STB_I.

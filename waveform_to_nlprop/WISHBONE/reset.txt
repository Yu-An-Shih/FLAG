WISHBONE reset behavior:
    Trace:
        RST_I: 0 1 1 0 0
        STB_I: X X 0 0 X
        CYC_I: X X 0 0 X
        X means the signal can evaluate to any value at that cycle.
    Signal descriptions:
        RST_I: Active-high reset signal.
        STB_I (source: master): Active-high strobe signal.
        CYC_I (source: master): Active-high cycle signal.
    Instructions:
        1. Please focus on how RST_I affect other signals.

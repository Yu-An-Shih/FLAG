WISHBONE reset behavior:
    Trace:
        The trace executes for 5 clock cycles. Initially at cycle 1, (RST_I, STB_I, CYC_I) = (LOW, X, X). Cycle 2: RST_I turns HIGH. Cycle 3: STB_I and CYC_I become LOW. Cycle 4: RST_I turns LOW. Cycle 5: STB_I and CYC_I become X.
        X means the signal can evaluate to any value at that cycle.
    Signal descriptions:
        RST_I: Active-high reset signal.
        STB_I (source: master): Active-high strobe signal.
        CYC_I (source: master): Active-high cycle signal.
    Instructions:
        1. Please focus on how RST_I affect other signals.

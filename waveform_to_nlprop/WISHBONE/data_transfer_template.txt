- If <valid signal> is HIGH and <ready signal> is LOW, then <valid signal> must be HIGH in the next cycle.
- If <valid signal> is HIGH and <ready signal> is LOW, then <information signal> must remain stable in the next cycle.
- If <valid signal> transitions from LOW to HIGH, then <ready signal> must be HIGH eventually.
- If <ready signal> is HIGH, then <valid signal> must be LOW in the next cycle.

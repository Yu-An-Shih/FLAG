CYC_I (source: master): Active-high cycle signal. Indicates that a valid bus cycle is in progress.
STB_I (source: master): Active-high strobe signal. Indicates that a data transfer cycle is in progress. A valid bus cycle can consist of multiple data transfer cycles.
ACK_O (source: slave): Active-high acknowledge signal. Indicates the termination of a normal data transfer cycle.
ERR_O (source: slave): Active-high error signal. Indicates the termination of an abnormal data transfer cycle.
RTY_O (source: slave): Active-high retry signal. Indicates that the interface is not ready to send or accept data, and the data transfer cycle should be retried.
ADR_I (source: master): Address array.
DAT_I (source: master): Data array.
DAT_O (source: slave): Data array.
SEL_I (source: master): Select array. Indicates where valid data is placed on the DAT_I/DAT_O during WRITE/READ cycles.
WE_I (source: master): Write-enable signal. This signal is LOW/HIGH during a READ/WRITE cycle.

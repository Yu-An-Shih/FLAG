WISHBONE handshake protocol for data transfer:
    Trace 1: Single READ cycle
        STB_I: 0  1  1  1  1 0
        ACK_O: 0  0  0  0  1 0
        ADR_I: X V1 V1 V1 V1 X
        DAT_I: X  X  X  X  X X
        DAT_O: X  X  X  X V3 X
        SEL_I: X V2 V2 V2 V2 X
        WE_I:  X  0  0  0  0 X
        V1, V2 and V3 are constant values. X means the signal can evaluate to any value at that cycle.
    Trace 2: Single WRITE cycle
        STB_I: 0  1  1  1  1 0
        ACK_O: 0  0  0  0  1 0
        ADR_I: X V1 V1 V1 V1 X
        DAT_I: X V2 V2 V2 V2 X
        DAT_O: X  X  X  X  X X
        SEL_I: X V3 V3 V3 V3 X
        WE_I:  X  1  1  1  1 X
        V1, V2 and V3 are constant values. X means the signal can evaluate to any value at that cycle.
    Signal descriptions:
        STB_I (source: master): Active-high strobe (valid) signal. Indicates that valid data and control information are available.
        ACK_O (source: slave): Active-high acknowledge (ready) signal. Indicates that the slave is ready to accept data and control information.
        ADR_I (source: master): Control information.
        DAT_I (source: master): Data information.
        DAT_O (source: slave): Data information.
        SEL_I (source: master): Control information.
        WE_I (source: master): Control information. WE_I=0 indicates a READ cycle; WE_I=1 indicates a WRITE cycle.

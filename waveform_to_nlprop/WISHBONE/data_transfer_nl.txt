WISHBONE handshake protocol for data transfer:
    Trace 1: Single READ cycle
        The trace executes for 6 clock cycles. Initially at cycle 1, (STB_I, ACK_O, ADR_I, DAT_I, DAT_O, SEL_I, WE_I) = (LOW, LOW, X, X, X, X, X). Cycle 2: STB_I turns HIGH; ADR_I becomes V1; SEL_I becomes V2; WE_I becomes LOW. Cycle 5: ACK_O turns HIGH; DAT_O becomes V3. Cycle 6: STB_I and ACK_O turn LOW; ADR_I, DAT_O, SEL_I and WE_I become X.
        V1, V2 and V3 are constant values. X means the signal can evaluate to any value at that cycle.
    Trace 2: Single WRITE cycle
        The trace executes for 6 clock cycles. Initially at cycle 1, (STB_I, ACK_O, ADR_I, DAT_I, DAT_O, SEL_I, WE_I) = (LOW, LOW, X, X, X, X, X). Cycle 2: STB_I turns HIGH; ADR_I becomes V1; DAT_I becomes V2; SEL_I becomes V3; WE_I becomes HIGH. Cycle 5: ACK_O turns HIGH. Cycle 6: STB_I and ACK_O turn LOW; ADR_I, DAT_I, SEL_I and WE_I become X.
        V1, V2 and V3 are constant values. X means the signal can evaluate to any value at that cycle.
    Signal descriptions:
        STB_I (source: master): Active-high strobe (valid) signal. Indicates that valid data and control information are available.
        ACK_O (source: slave): Active-high acknowledge (ready) signal. Indicates that the slave is ready to accept data and control information.
        ADR_I (source: master): Control information.
        DAT_I (source: master): Data information.
        DAT_O (source: slave): Data information.
        SEL_I (source: master): Control information.
        WE_I (source: master): Control information. WE_I=0 indicates a READ cycle; WE_I=1 indicates a WRITE cycle.

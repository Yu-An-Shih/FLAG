Please act as a professional on-chip communication protocol specification analyzer.

The following is a list of signals and their short descriptions of the AMBA low-power Q-Channel interface specification:
QACTIVE: Can be driven HIGH by a device in any state to indicate that it has operations to perform. When it is driven LOW by a device, then it is a hint, not a guarantee that the device might accept a quiescence request.
QREQn: The quiescence request signal driven by the controller.
QACCEPTn: Driven by the device, used to accept the quiescence request.
QDENY: Driven by the device, used to deny a request.

You will be provided one or more waveforms of these signals in figure format. Please carefully analyze the waveforms and try to infer the rules these signals should follow when interacting with each other. Simply list all the rules and don't generate other texts. Please also refer to the following examples for possible rules while analyzing.
- [signal] is only permitted to change from HIGH to LOW when [signal] is HIGH.
- [signal] is only permitted to change from LOW to HIGH when [signal] is LOW.
Note that [signal] should be replaced by actual signals in the Q-Channel interface specification.

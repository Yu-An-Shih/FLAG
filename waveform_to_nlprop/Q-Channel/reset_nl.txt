Q-Channel reset behavior:
    Trace 1: QREQn LOW during reset
        The trace executes for 24 clock cycles. Initially at cycle 1, (RESETn, QREQn, QACCEPTn, QDENY) = (LOW, LOW, LOW, LOW). Cycle 4: RESETn turns HIGH. Cycle 7: QREQn turns HIGH. Cycle 10: QACCEPTn turns HIGH. Cycle 16: QREQn turns LOW. Cycle 19: QACCEPTn turns LOW. Cycle 22: RESETn turns LOW.
    Trace 2: QREQn HIGH during reset
        The trace executes for 21 clock cycles. Initially at cycle 1, (RESETn, QREQn, QACCEPTn, QDENY) = (LOW, HIGH, LOW, LOW). Cycle 4: RESETn turns HIGH. Cycle 7: QACCEPTn turns HIGH. Cycle 13: QREQn turns LOW. Cycle 16: QACCEPTn turns LOW. Cycle 19: RESETn turns LOW.
    Signal descriptions:
        RESETn: Active-low reset signal.
        QREQn (source: power controller): Active-low quiescence request signal.
        QACCEPTn (source: device): Active-low quiescence acceptance signal.
        QDENY (source: device): Active-high quiescence denial signal.

(1) Q-Channel low-power handshake
- <signal> is only permitted to change from HIGH to LOW when <condition>.
- <signal> is only permitted to change from LOW to HIGH when <condition>.

(1) WISHBONE data transfer
- If <valid signal> is HIGH and <ready signal> is LOW, then <valid signal> must be HIGH in the next cycle.
- If <valid signal> is HIGH and <ready signal> is LOW, then <information signal> must remain stable in the next cycle.
- If <valid signal> transitions from LOW to HIGH, then <ready signal> must be HIGH eventually.
- If <ready signal> is HIGH, then <valid signal> must be LOW in the next cycle.

(1) WISHBONE CYC vs STB
- <signal> is only permitted to change from LOW to HIGH when <condition>.
- If <signal> is <value>, then <signal> must be <value>.

(1) WISHBONE reset
- If <signal> is <value>, then <signal> must be <value>.
- If <signal> is <value>, then <signal> must be <value> in the next cycle.

(1)
- <signal> is only permitted to change from LOW to HIGH when <condition>.
- If <signal> is <value>, then <signal> must be <value>.
- If <signal> is <value>, then <signal> must be <value> in the next cycle.

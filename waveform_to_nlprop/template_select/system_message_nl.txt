You are an expert in on-chip communication protocols and formal verification. Your task is to summarize signal behavior rules of a protocol by looking at hardware waveforms.

You will be provided with the following:
1. Templates of possible signal behavior rules for on-chip communication protocols. The templates are categorized based on different situations.
2. Waveform information: (1) Waveforms decribed by natural language, accompanied with (2) signal descriptions and (3) optional instructions.
Carefully analyze the waveform information, and select the templates that are related to the situation. Note that the categories are just for references - please pick whatever templates you think are suitable based on your analysis.

Simply list all the selected templates and don't generate other texts. Only list the templates.

Templates:
VALID/READY handshake for transfering information:
- If <valid signal> is HIGH and <ready signal> is LOW, then <valid signal> must be HIGH in the next cycle.
- If <valid signal> is HIGH and <ready signal> is LOW, then <information signal> must remain stable in the next cycle.
- If <valid signal> transitions from LOW to HIGH, then <ready signal> must be HIGH eventually.
- If <ready signal> is HIGH, then <valid signal> must be LOW in the next cycle.
Low-power handshake mechanism:
- <signal> is only permitted to change from HIGH to LOW when <condition>.
- <signal> is only permitted to change from LOW to HIGH when <condition>.
Others:
- If <signal> is <value>, then <signal> must be <value>.
- If <signal> is <value>, then <signal> must be <value> in the next cycle.

(1) Q-Channel low-power handshake
1. QREQn is only permitted to change from HIGH to LOW when QACCEPTn is HIGH and QDENY is LOW.
2. QREQn is only permitted to change from LOW to HIGH when QACCEPTn is LOW or QDENY is HIGH.
3. QACCEPTn is only permitted to change from HIGH to LOW when QREQn is LOW and QDENY is LOW.
4. QACCEPTn is only permitted to change from LOW to HIGH when QREQn is HIGH.
5. QDENY is only permitted to change from LOW to HIGH when QREQn is LOW and QACCEPTn is HIGH.
6. QDENY is only permitted to change from HIGH to LOW when QREQn is HIGH.

(1) Q-Channel reset
1. QREQn is only permitted to change from LOW to HIGH when RESETn is HIGH.    -- redundant
2. QACCEPTn is only permitted to change from LOW to HIGH when RESETn is HIGH. -- redundant
3. If RESETn is LOW, then QREQn must be LOW.                                  -- mismatch waveform
4. If RESETn is LOW, then QACCEPTn must be LOW.
5. If RESETn is LOW, then QDENY must be LOW.

(1) WISHBONE data transfer
- If STB_I is HIGH and ACK_O is LOW, then STB_I must be HIGH in the next cycle.
- If STB_I is HIGH and ACK_O is LOW, then ADR_I must remain stable in the next cycle.
- If STB_I is HIGH and ACK_O is LOW, then SEL_I must remain stable in the next cycle.
- If STB_I is HIGH and ACK_O is LOW, then WE_I must remain stable in the next cycle.
- If STB_I is HIGH and ACK_O is LOW, then DAT_I must remain stable in the next cycle (for WRITE cycle). -- mismatch waveform?
- If STB_I transitions from LOW to HIGH, then ACK_O must be HIGH eventually.
- If ACK_O is HIGH, then STB_I must be LOW in the next cycle.

(1) WISHBONE CYC vs STB
- CYC_I is only permitted to change from LOW to HIGH when STB_I is LOW.  -- mismatch waveform
- STB_I is only permitted to change from LOW to HIGH when CYC_I is HIGH. -- redundant
- ACK_O is only permitted to change from LOW to HIGH when STB_I is HIGH. -- mismatch RTL?
- If CYC_I is LOW, then STB_I must be LOW.
- If STB_I is HIGH, then CYC_I must be HIGH.                             -- redundant

(1) WISHBONE reset
- If RST_I is HIGH, then STB_I must be LOW.                   -- mismatch waveform
- If RST_I is HIGH, then CYC_I must be LOW.                   -- mismatch waveform
- If RST_I is HIGH, then STB_I must be LOW in the next cycle.
- If RST_I is HIGH, then CYC_I must be LOW in the next cycle.

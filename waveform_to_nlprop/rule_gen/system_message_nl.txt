You are an expert in on-chip communication protocols and formal verification. Your task is to summarize signal behavior rules of a protocol by looking at hardware waveforms.

You will be provided with the following:
1. Waveform information: (1) Waveforms decribed by natural language, accompanied with (2) signal descriptions and (3) optional instructions.
2. Templates of possible signal behavior rules that can be inferred from the waveforms.
Carefully analyze the waveform information and refer to the templates. For each template, try to generate as many rules as possible that can be inferred from the waveforms.

Simply list all the rules and don't generate other texts.

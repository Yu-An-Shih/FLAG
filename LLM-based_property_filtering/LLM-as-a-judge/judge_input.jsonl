You will be provided with (1) a specification document of an on-chip communication protocol and (2) a list of SVA properties that describes a specific mechanism of the protocol. Evaluate the property list based on the following criteria:\n1. Correctness: For each property, check if it accurately captures the intended behavior of the target mechanism as described in the specification document. The result should be one of the following: \n    (1) Correct\n    (2) Incorrect: Directly violates the intended behavior of the mechanism.\n    (3) Implementation-based: Not specified by the document but might hold true depending on actual RTL implementations.\n    (4) Irrelevant: Not related to the target mechanism.\n2. Redundancy: Identify properties that are redundant, meaning they convey the same information as other properties in the list.\n3. Missing properties: Identify any critical properties (description in natural language is fine) that are missing from the list but are necessary to fully describe the target mechanism based on the specification document. Respond with \"None\" if there are no missing properties.\n", "input": [{"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "input_file", "file_id": "file-2aYovVdYj2zKMoHGVaSjaE"}, {"type": "input_text", "text": "SVA properties for Q-Channel handshake:\n// 1.
